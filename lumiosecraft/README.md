## About

This modpack features Cobblemon, allowing players to explore the world, catch and train Pokémon-like creatures, and engage in battles. Create is included to provide an interesting automation system for streamlining processes such as Poké Ball crafting, item transportation, and mechanical contraptions.

The modpack encourages creativity, teamwork, and adventure, making it a perfect balance between exploration, strategy, and engineering.

Whether you're a Pokémon trainer looking to become the very best or an engineer who loves designing complex machinery, this modpack offers something for everyone!

Other than Cobblemon and Create the modpack contains mods like Sodium to improve performance on the client-side as well as server-side.

The [MysticMons](https://modrinth.com/datapack/mysticmons) and [AllTheMons](https://modrinth.com/datapack/allthemons) datapacks have been used to add missing cobblemon models to the modpack.
